Apple II code I have developed, mostly during the 80s

This repository is intended to be a compilation of some of the software I have developed for the Apple II computers

I have packed the code in several forlders, one for each interesting program. The files are stored in different formats:

'.BAS' ASCII encoded Microsoft or AppleSOft BASIC source file

'.DSK' Diskette emulation format, for use in Virtual II and BMOW Floppy Emulator

Currently, I am having some fun not only recovering these old programs, but also modifying them and even creating new ones. Check here for periodic updates.
